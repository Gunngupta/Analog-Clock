# Rock vs Mine Pediction
<br>
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. The model is trained using sonar data, which consists of various frequency-based features.

<br>
<b><h2>Tool and Library</h2></b><br>
1. The dataset used for training the model contains sonar readings taken from objects in water.<br>
2. Each instance consists of 60 numerical attributes, representing energy levels at different frequencies.<br>
3. The target variable is Rock (R) or Mine (M).<br>

<br>
<b><h2>Tech Stack</h2></b><br>
1. Python<br>
2. Numpy<br>
3. Pandas<br>
4. Scikit-learn
